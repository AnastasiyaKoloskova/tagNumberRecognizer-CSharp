tagNumberRecognizer-CSharp
==========================

Python one wasn't good so we decided to make the one on C#

About running - this application uses OpenCV and OpenCVSharp libraries.

The versions of both libs must be the same, for example, 2.4.5
Otherwise - the app will not run.

The detailed explanation about of using this app will be given in official documentation. A bit later :).

Guys - do not hesitate to change this file to make it perfect :).
